[01:46.65] Blindness and foresight
[01:48.83] Lost in the songs of old
[01:55.48] Frozen and timeless
[01:57.74] Words that were carved in stone
[02:13.24] 
[02:04.59] Embrace the dark
[02:06.82] The night is temporary
[02:08.94] We dream and dance
[02:11.38] The chaos holds us tightly
[02:13.66] There's no return
[02:15.73] I feel the seconds take me
[02:18.03] We chase the light
[02:20.28] And be forever maybe
[02:30.28] 
[03:24.95] Embrace the dark
[03:26.95] The night is temporary
[03:29.27] We dream and dance
[03:31.42] The chaos holds us tightly
[03:33.41] There's no return
[03:35.61] I feel the seconds take me
[03:38.04] We chase the light
[03:40.26] And be forever maybe
